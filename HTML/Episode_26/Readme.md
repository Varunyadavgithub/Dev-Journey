## üß© Common HTML Mistakes

Here are some of the most common mistakes developers make when writing HTML and how to avoid them:

### 1. **Forgetting to Close Tags**

- One of the most frequent mistakes is forgetting to close HTML tags, especially self-closing tags like `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<hr>`. Always ensure that every tag is properly closed.

```html
<!-- Incorrect -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />

<!-- Correct -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />
```

### 2. **Using Non-Semantic Tags**

- Avoid using non-semantic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` for structuring the layout of your page. Instead, use semantic HTML5 tags that describe the content, such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, etc.

```html
<!-- Incorrect -->
<div class="header">Header content</div>

<!-- Correct -->
<header>Header content</header>
```

### 3. **Overusing Inline Styles**

- Inline styles can make your HTML difficult to maintain. Instead of applying styles directly to elements, it's better to use external stylesheets for better separation of concerns.

```html
<!-- Incorrect -->
<h1 style="color: red;">Title</h1>

<!-- Correct -->
<h1 class="title">Title</h1>
```

### 4. **Using Deprecated Tags**

- HTML5 has introduced many new elements, so avoid using deprecated or outdated tags such as `<font>`, `<center>`, and `<b>`. Use CSS for styling instead.

```html
<!-- Incorrect -->
<font color="red">Text</font>

<!-- Correct -->
<span class="text-red">Text</span>
```

### 5. **Not Using Alt Attributes for Images**

- Always include the `alt` attribute for `<img>` tags. This improves accessibility for users with disabilities and helps search engines understand the content of images.

```html
<!-- Incorrect -->
<img src="image.jpg" />

<!-- Correct -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" />
```

### 6. **Using Empty or Unnecessary Tags**

- Avoid using empty tags or unnecessary elements in your HTML, such as `<div></div>` if no content is inside or it isn't needed for layout purposes.

```html
<!-- Incorrect -->
<div></div>

<!-- Correct -->
<!-- Remove empty div or use a more appropriate tag -->
```

### 7. **Not Organizing Code Properly**

- Keep your HTML code organized by properly indenting it. Use consistent indentation and separate sections of your document with comments for better readability.

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<section>
  <header>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Content goes here.</p>
</section>
```
