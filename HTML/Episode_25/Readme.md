## üìù Tips for Writing Clean HTML

Here are some best practices to ensure your HTML code is clean and easy to manage:

### 1. **Use Semantic HTML Tags**

- Always use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to structure your content meaningfully.
- This improves readability, accessibility, and SEO.

```html
<article>
  <h2>Title of the Article</h2>
  <p>Content of the article...</p>
</article>
```

### 2. **Proper Indentation**

- Indent your code properly to improve its readability. Use consistent spaces or tabs to ensure that your HTML structure is clear.

```html
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### 3. **Close All Tags**

- Always close your HTML tags, even self-closing tags like `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<hr>`. This ensures compatibility across different browsers and prevents rendering issues.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="description" />
```

### 4. **Avoid Inline Styles and Scripts**

- Avoid using inline CSS and JavaScript whenever possible. Instead, place styles in a separate CSS file and scripts in a JavaScript file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<script src="scripts.js"></script>
```

### 5. **Use Descriptive Attribute Values**

- Make sure that attributes like `alt`, `title`, and `aria-label` are descriptive and meaningful.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the beach" />
```

### 6. **Avoid Deprecated Elements**

- Avoid using deprecated HTML elements such as `<font>`, `<center>`, and `<b>`. Use CSS for styling instead.
