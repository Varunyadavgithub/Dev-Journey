## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this episode, you will:

- Understand the use of HTML heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Learn how to structure text using paragraph tags
- Know the importance of semantic structure in HTML documents

## 🏷️ HTML Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important). These help organize content hierarchically.

### ✅ Syntax:

```html
<h1>This is a level 1 heading</h1>
<h2>This is a level 2 heading</h2>
<h3>This is a level 3 heading</h3>
<h4>This is a level 4 heading</h4>
<h5>This is a level 5 heading</h5>
<h6>This is a level 6 heading</h6>
```

### 📌 Best Practices:

- Use only **one `<h1>`** per page (usually the page title).
- Use headings **sequentially** to maintain document structure and accessibility.
- Avoid skipping heading levels unnecessarily.

## 🧾 Paragraph Tag (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph of text.

### ✅ Syntax:

```html
<p>
  This is a paragraph. HTML automatically adds space before and after the
  paragraph.
</p>
```

### 🔍 Key Notes:

- A browser will automatically insert some white space (margin) before and after a paragraph.
- If you add multiple spaces or line breaks in a paragraph, HTML **ignores** extra whitespace.

## 🧪 Example

<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
