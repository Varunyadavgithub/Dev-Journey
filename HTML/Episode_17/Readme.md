- `<header>`: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links.
- `<nav>`: Represents a navigation section.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.
- `<section>`: Represents a standalone section.
- `<article>`: Represents self-contained content like blog posts or articles.
- `<footer>`: Represents footer content.

## 📙 What are Non-Semantic Tags?

Non-semantic tags don’t provide any meaning about their content.

### 🚫 Examples of Non-Semantic Tags:

- `<div>`: Generic container for content.
