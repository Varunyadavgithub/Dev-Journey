## 🌐 What is Web Development?

Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites. It can be divided into:

### 1. **Frontend Development (Client-Side)**
- Everything the user sees and interacts with.
- Technologies used: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**.
- Examples: Website layout, buttons, forms, animations.

### 2. **Backend Development (Server-Side)**
- Everything that happens behind the scenes.
- Involves servers, databases, and server-side logic.
- Technologies used: **Node.js**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Java**, **Databases**.

### 3. **Full-Stack Development**
- Combination of both frontend and backend.

## 🖥️ What is the Frontend?

The **frontend** is the visual part of a website that users interact with directly.

- **HTML** — provides structure.
- **CSS** — provides style.
- **JavaScript** — provides interactivity.

### 🎯 Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my very first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Text Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Sublime Text, Atom.
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (for testing and viewing).
- **Live Server Extension** (VS Code): To see your changes live.

## 📦 Project Structure Tip

Always create a folder for your projects:
```

```

## 💡 Pro Tip

Use `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open **Developer Tools** in your browser. This will help you inspect, debug, and experiment with HTML in real-time.
