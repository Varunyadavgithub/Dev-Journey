## 🔗 The Anchor Tag (`<a>`)

The `<a>` tag is used to define a hyperlink that can link to:

- Another webpage
- An external website
- A specific section within the same page
- An email address
- A file download

---

## ✍️ Syntax

```html
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
```

## 🎯 The `target` Attribute

The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

| Value     | Description                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `_self`   | Default. Opens in the same tab       |
| `_blank`  | Opens in a new tab or window         |
| `_parent` | Opens in the parent frame            |
| `_top`    | Opens in the full body of the window |

## 💡 Examples

### ✅ Basic Link:

## 🚨 Best Practices
