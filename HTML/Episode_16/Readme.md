## 🏗️ Basic Structure of an HTML Document

Here’s what a typical HTML5 boilerplate looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## 🧩 Tag Breakdown

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document as HTML5
- `<html>`: Root element of the HTML page
- `<head>`: Metadata, links to stylesheets, and other resources
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Sets character encoding
- `<meta name="viewport" ...>`: Makes the page responsive on all devices
- `<title>`: Defines the title shown in the browser tab
- `<body>`: Contains all visible content on the page

---

## 💡 Tips

- Always include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top.
- Keep your indentation clean for better readability.
- Use `<meta>` tags for better SEO and mobile responsiveness.

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

Create a new file called `index.html` and paste the boilerplate code above. Modify the `<title>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` tags to practice.
