## üè∑Ô∏è The `label` Tag

The `label` tag is used to define labels for input elements. It improves accessibility by making it easier for screen readers to associate a label with the corresponding input field.

### Syntax:

```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username" />
```

### Key Points:

- The `for` attribute of the `label` must match the `id` of the associated input element.
- This allows users to click the label to focus on the input field.

## üß≥ The `fieldset` Tag

The `fieldset` tag is used to group related form elements. It visually groups related controls, making forms more organized.

### Syntax:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Personal Information</legend>
  <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" />
  <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lastName" name="lastName" />
</fieldset>
```

### Key Points:

- The `fieldset` element can contain multiple form controls.
- It is often paired with the `legend` tag to provide a description for the group.

## üèÖ The `legend` Tag

The `legend` tag is used to define a caption for the content inside a `fieldset`. It provides a title for the group of related elements.

### Syntax:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Contact Information</legend>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
</fieldset>
```

### Key Points:

- The `legend` tag must be the first child of the `fieldset` element.
- It helps screen readers and users visually identify the purpose of the grouped fields.

## üí° Tips

- Use `fieldset` and `legend` for better organization, especially in forms with multiple sections.
- Always associate labels with inputs to improve accessibility for all users.
