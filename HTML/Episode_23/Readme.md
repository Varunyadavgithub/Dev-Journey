## üß© What Are Meta Tags?

Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document. They are placed inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML file and are not visible on the webpage. These tags help search engines understand the content of your page and enhance the user experience.

### Syntax:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Learn HTML with hands-on examples and tutorials."
  />
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, HTML tutorial, web development" />
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe" />
</head>
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Important Meta Tags for SEO

### 1. `description` Tag

The `description` tag provides a summary of the webpage content. It is often displayed in search engine results.

### Syntax:

```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="This is a webpage about HTML basics and tutorials."
/>
```

### 2. `keywords` Tag

The `keywords` tag is used to specify relevant keywords for the webpage. This tag is not as important for SEO anymore but can still help in some cases.

### Syntax:

```html
<meta
  name="keywords"
  content="HTML, web development, tutorials, HTML tutorial"
/>
```

### 3. `viewport` Tag

The `viewport` tag helps control the layout on mobile devices. It ensures the page scales correctly on different screen sizes.

### Syntax:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

To optimize your content for social media platforms, use Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags. These meta tags enhance the preview when your content is shared.

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Learn HTML" />
<meta
  property="og:description"
  content="A comprehensive HTML tutorial for beginners"
/>
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/og-image.jpg" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com" />
```

### Twitter Card Example:

```html
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Learn HTML" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Comprehensive HTML tutorial" />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://example.com/twitter-image.jpg" />
```
