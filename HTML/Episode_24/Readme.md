Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites usable for all people, including those with disabilities. Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of physical abilities or limitations, can access and interact with your website‚Äôs content.

## üè∑Ô∏è `aria-` Attributes

The `aria-` attributes are part of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification, which provides a way to make dynamic web content and advanced user interface controls accessible to people with disabilities.

### Common `aria-` Attributes:

1. **`aria-label`**
   The `aria-label` attribute provides an accessible name for an element, which is especially useful for screen readers.

   ### Syntax:

   ```html
   <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
   ```

   This button will be announced as "Close" to screen readers.

2. **`aria-labelledby`**
   The `aria-labelledby` attribute references an element's ID to provide an accessible name.

   ### Syntax:

   ```html
   <h1 id="page-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>
   <button aria-labelledby="page-title">Learn More</button>
   ```

   This button will be announced with the text from the `<h1>` tag.

3. **`aria-hidden`**
   The `aria-hidden` attribute hides elements from screen readers, even if they are visible on the page.

   ### Syntax:

   ```html
   <div aria-hidden="true">
     This content will not be read by screen readers.
   </div>
   ```

4. **`aria-live`**
   The `aria-live` attribute is used for announcing dynamic content changes, such as updates to a message or status.

   ### Syntax:

   ```html
   <div aria-live="polite">Content updated!</div>
   ```

   This will announce the updated content when it changes.

- Use `aria-` attributes only when native HTML elements cannot provide the necessary functionality.
- Always ensure elements have clear and descriptive accessible names for screen readers.
- Test your website with screen readers to ensure accessibility.
